# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 19, 2019

**Plan: study Github tutorial, do code

**Today's Progress**: Passed GitHub tutorial (again!). Uploaded my project (sudoku_solver). I will be developing it further. Today, I added function to check if the solution submitted by user is correct or not.

**Thoughts:** Progress is not much, but this is just the beginning.

**Link to work:** [Sudoku_solver](https://github.com/Solairw/sudoku_solver)
